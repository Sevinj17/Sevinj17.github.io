					<h4>ARMY</h4>
					And you gonna ask: What is ARMY? ARMY it's a fandom of BTS. Every Kpop group has a ocean of fans.And Kpop idols call them fandom. And every Kpop group give their fandom a name. BTS gave their fandom a name called ARMY. Because BTS' Korean name is 방탄서년단 (bangtan sonyeondan), and it means Bulletproof Boy Scouts.
                    To keep their theme/concept of bulletproof, they made us their ARMY.The Bulletproof Boy Scouts are like “armor/shield” which goes hand in hand with ARMY which is like“military”. It also means that BTS and ARMY will never be separated. But then they changed their name and now BTS is like Burn The Stage(read the first letters).
